        "Let us be lovers we’ll marry our fortunes together"
        "I’ve got some real estate here in my bag"
        So we bought a pack of cigarettes and Mrs. Wagner pies
        And we walked off to look for America

        "Kathy," I said as we boarded a Greyhound in Pittsburgh
        "Michigan seems like a dream to me now"
        It took me four days to hitchhike from Saginaw
        I’ve gone to look for America

        Laughing on the bus
        Playing games with the faces
        She said the man in the gabardine suit was a spy
        I said "Be careful his bowtie is really a camera"

        "Toss me a cigarette, I think there’s one in my raincoat"
        "We smoked the last one an hour ago"
        So I looked at the scenery, she read her magazine
        And the moon rose over an open field

        "Kathy, I’m lost," I said, though I knew she was sleeping
        I’m empty and aching and I don’t know why
        Counting the cars on the New Jersey Turnpike
        They’ve all gone to look for America
        All gone to look for America
        All gone to look for America

        And give me a sigh
        Give me a kiss before you tell me goodbye
        Don’t you take it so hard now
        And please don’t take it so bad
        I’ll still be thinking of you
        And the times we had...baby

        Bury me softly in this womb
        I give this part of me for you
        Sand rains down and here I sit
        Holding rare flowers
        In a tomb... in Bloom

        Down in a hole and I don’t know
        if I can be saved
        I sing my heart out decorated
        like a grave
        You don’t understand who they
        thought I was supposed to be
        Look at me now I’m a man
        who won’t let himself be

        Down in a hole, losing my soul
        Down in a hole, losing control
        I’d like to fly,
        But my wings have been so denied

        Down in a hole and they’ve put all
        The stones in their place
        I’ve eaten the sun so my tongue
        Has been burned of the taste
        I have been guilty
        Of kicking myself in the teeth
        I will bring no more
        Of my feelings beneath

        Down in a hole, losing my soul
        Down in a hole, losing control
        I’d like to fly but my
        Wings have been so denied

        Bury me softly in this womb
        Oh I want to be inside of you
        I give this part of me for you
        Oh I want to be inside of you
        Sand rains down and here I sit
        Holding rare flowers (oh I want to be inside of you)
        In a tomb...
        Oh I want to be inside...

        Down in a hole, losing my soul
        Down in a hole, feeling so small
        Down in a hole, losing my soul
        Down in a hole, out of control
        I’d like to fly but my
        Wings have been so denied

        I’m sittin’ in the railway station,
        got a ticket for my destination
        On a tour of one-night-stands,
        my suitcase and guitar in hand
        And every stop is neatly planned
        for a poet and a one-man band

        Homeward bound,
        I wish I was homeward bound
        Home, where my thoughts escapin’,
        home, where my music’s playin’
        Home, where my love lies waitin’
        silently for me

        Every day’s an endless stream
        of cigarettes and magazines
        And each town looks the same to me,
        the movies and the factories
        And every stranger’s face I see
        reminds me that I long to be

        Tonight I’ll sing my songs again,
        I’ll play the game and pretend
        But all my words come back to me,
        in shades of mediocrity
        Like emptiness and harmony,
        I need someone to comfort me

        Silently for me

        What a drag it is getting old
        "Kids are different today"
        I hear ev’ry mother say
        Mother needs something today to calm her down
        And though she’s not really ill
        There’s a little yellow pill
        She goes running for the shelter of a mother’s little helper
        And it helps her on her way, gets her through her busy day

        "Things are different today"
        I hear ev’ry mother say
        Cooking fresh food for a husband’s just a drag
        So she buys an instant cake and she burns her frozen steak
        And goes running for the shelter of a mother’s little helper
        And two help her on her way, get her through her busy day

        Doctor please, some more of these
        Outside the door, she took four more
        What a drag it is getting old

        "Men just aren’t the same today"
        I hear ev’ry mother say
        They just don’t appreciate that you get tired
        They’re so hard to satisfy, You can tranquilize your mind
        So go running for the shelter of a mother’s little helper
        And four help you through the night, help to minimize your plight

        Doctor please, some more of these
        Outside the door, she took four more
        What a drag it is getting old

        "Life’s just much too hard today,"
        I hear ev’ry mother say
        The pursuit of happiness just seems a bore
        And if you take more of those, you will get an overdose
        No more running for the shelter of a mother’s little helper
        They just helped you on your way, through your busy dying day

        Just a perfect day,
        Drink Sangria in the park,
        And then later, when it gets dark,
        We go home.

        Just a perfect day,
        Feed animals in the zoo
        Then later, a movie, too,
        And then home.

        Oh it’s such a perfect day,
        I’m glad I spent it with you.
        Oh such a perfect day,
        You just keep me hanging on,
        You just keep me hanging on.

        Just a perfect day,
        Problems all left alone,
        Weekenders on our own.
        It’s such fun.

        Just a perfect day,
        You made me forget myself.

        Someone good

        Can’t leave and can’t forget
        We ain’t right, we ain’t right
        Not right, we ain’t right

        (backround)Well it’s hard to believe that somebody tricked you

        Didn’t know what time it was, the lights were low
        I leaned back on my radio
        Some cat was layin’ down some rock’n’roll lotta soul, he said
        Then the loud sound did seem to fade
        Came back like a slow voice on a wave of phase
        That weren’t no D.J. that was hazy cosmic jive

        There’s a starman waiting in the sky
        He’d like to come and meet us
        But he thinks he’d blow our minds
        There’s a starman waiting in the sky
        He told us not to blow it

        ’Cause he knows it’s all worthwhile
        He told me :
        Let the children lose it
        Let the children use it
        Let all the children boogie
        I had to phone someone so I picked on you
        Hey, that’s far out so you heard him too !
        Switch on the TV we may pick him up on channel two
        Look out your window I can see his light
        If we can sparkle he may land tonight
        Don’t tell your poppa or he’ll get us locked up in fright

        We’ll be fighting in the streets
        With our children at our feet
        And the morals that they worship will be gone
        And the men who spurred us on
        Sit in judgment of all wrong
        They decide and the shotgun sings the song

        I’ll tip my hat to the new constitution
        Take a bow for the new revolution
        Smile and grin at the change all around me
        Pick up my guitar and play
        Just like yesterday
        And I’ll get on my knees and pray
        We don’t get fooled again
        Don’t get fooled again

        Change it had to come
        We knew it all along
        We were liberated from the fall that’s all
        But the world looks just the same
        And history ain’t changed
        ’Cause the banners, they all flown in the last war

        I’ll tip my hat to the new constitution
        Take a bow for the new revolution
        Smile and grin at the change all around me
        Pick up my guitar and play
        Just like yesterday
        And I’ll get on my knees and pray
        We don’t get fooled again
        Don’t get fooled again
        No, no !

        I’ll move myself and my family aside
        If we happen to be left half alive
        I’ll get all my papers and smile at the sky
        For I know that the hypnotized never lie

        Do ya ?

        There’s nothing in the street
        Looks any different to me
        And the slogans are replaced, by-the-bye
        And the parting on the left
        Is now the parting on the right
        And the beards have all grown longer overnight

        I’ll tip my hat to the new constitution
        Take a bow for the new revolution
        Smile and grin at the change all around me
        Pick up my guitar and play

        Then I’ll get on my knees and pray

        Ziggy played guitar, jammin’ good with Weird and Gilly,
        And The spiders from Mars, he played it left hand
        But made it too far
        Became the special man, then we were Ziggy’s band

        Ziggy really sang, screwed up eyes and screwed down hairdo
        Like some cat from Japan, he could lick ’em by smiling
        He could leave ’em to hang
        Came on so loaded man, well hung and snow white tan

        So where were the spiders
        While the fly tried to break our balls
        Just a beer light to guide us
        So we bitched about his fans and should we crush his sweet hands ?

        Ziggy played for time, jiving us that we was voodoo
        The kids was just crass. He was the nazz
        With God given ass
        He took it all too far, but boy could he play guitar

        Making love with his ego,
        Ziggy sucked up into his mind
        Like a leper messiah
        When the kids had killed the man I had to break up the band
